Task Management Application
Description
This is a simple Task Management Application designed to help you track and manage your tasks. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, while also providing the ability to track their progress. The app is powered by MySQL for data storage, and it leverages Retool for building the user interface, with VS Code as the development environment.

Features:
Create new tasks with a title, description, due date, and status.
Edit task details, including the title, description, and due date.
Update task status (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
Delete tasks.
Responsive design for task management.
Technologies Used:
Backend: MySQL Database
Frontend: Retool
Development Environment: VS Code
Programming Languages: SQL, JavaScript (for Retool customization)
Installation
Prerequisites:
Ensure that you have MySQL installed on your local machine or have access to a MySQL server.
Ensure you have VS Code installed.
Retool account for building and hosting the UI.
Step 1: Set up MySQL Database
Create the database:

sql

CREATE DATABASE task_management;
Create the tasks table:

sql

USE task_management;

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    due_date DATE,
    status ENUM('Pending', 'In Progress', 'Completed') DEFAULT 'Pending'
);
Insert some sample data (optional):

sql

INSERT INTO tasks (title, description, due_date, status)
VALUES 
('Task 1', 'Complete the project documentation', '2025-01-10', 'Pending'),
('Task 2', 'Update the task management application', '2025-01-15', 'In Progress');
Step 2: Set up Retool
Sign up or log into Retool: Visit Retool and sign in or create a new account.

Create a new application: Start a new project by clicking on Create new app.

Connect to your MySQL database:

Go to the "Resource" tab and add a new resource for MySQL.
Provide the connection details (host, username, password, database name).
Build the UI:

Use Retool's drag-and-drop interface to create tables, forms, and buttons for task management.
Bind the data from MySQL to the components to allow interaction with the tasks.
Define actions:

Create actions for adding, updating, deleting tasks.
Use Retool’s JavaScript actions to control the task operations and update the UI dynamically.
Step 3: Run the Application
Test the task management system: Use Retool’s preview mode to interact with your application, add tasks, update them, and track their status.
Deploy the application: Once you're satisfied with the design and functionality, deploy your Retool app to start managing tasks in real-time.

 you're only testing the API, it is not necessary to visit http://localhost:3000/. Instead, you should test your actual API endpoints like:
http://localhost:3000/tasks (to get the list of tasks)
http://localhost:3000/tasks/1 (to get a task by ID)
